# Neural-Network-Cars

Fork of project by ReadySetPython (https://github.com/ReadySetPython/Neural-Network-Cars/tree/master). I started off edited the game file so I could understand how it works, since then I've been experimenting with the neural net design. To try it yourself, clone this repo and run nnCarGame.py. gamecode.py contains code that only affects the game and not the neural nets, so it's kept in another file for readability, but you need both (and the game images) to run the program.

Updated a bunch of functions, mainly the code for mutating the neural nets. Added non-uniform probability distributions and changed the way traits are inherited.
