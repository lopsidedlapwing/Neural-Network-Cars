# Neural-Network-Cars

Fork of project by ReadySetPython (https://github.com/ReadySetPython/Neural-Network-Cars/tree/master). I started off editing the game file so I could understand how it works, since then I've been experimenting with the neural net design. To try it yourself, clone this repo and run nnCarGame.py. All the files in this project are required - gamecode.py contains code that only affects the game and not the neural nets, so it's kept in another file for readability, but it's still essential along with the images.

Updated a bunch of functions, mainly the code for mutating the neural nets. Added non-uniform probability distributions and changed the way traits are inherited.
