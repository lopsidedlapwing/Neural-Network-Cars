# Neural-Network-Cars

Fork of original project by ReadySetPython (https://github.com/ReadySetPython/Neural-Network-Cars/tree/master); I edited the game file to make it more readable. Might update this in future with more complex NNs etc. To try it yourself, clone this repo and run nnCarGame.py.

Updated a bunch of functions, mainly the code for mutating the neural nets. Is now significantly faster, plus uniform distribution replaced with normal distribution.
